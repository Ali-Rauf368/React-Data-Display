Project Title

React Data Display App
Overview

This project is a simple React application that displays user information, posts, and photos using predefined data sets. The app demonstrates how to use React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage and render data dynamically.
Features

    User Data Display: Information about different users such as name, username, email, address, phone number, and company details.
    Posts Data Display: A list of posts tied to specific users.
    Photos Display: A gallery of photos with titles and URLs, displayed alongside thumbnail images.

Technologies Used

    React: The core library for building user interfaces.
    JavaScript (ES6): Modern JavaScript features like destructuring and arrow functions.
    CSS: Basic styling using an external App.css file.

How It Works

    The app imports three predefined data sets: usersData, postsData, and photosData.
        usersData: Contains details about users (name, contact information, etc.).
        postsData: Contains a list of posts associated with users.
        photosData: Contains a list of photos with URLs and thumbnails.

    The app utilizes Reactâ€™s useState to manage state and useEffect to simulate data fetching from external sources.

    The app dynamically renders the user data, post titles, and photos on the page, allowing users to view these details in a simple and interactive way.
